# Interactive Image Compression Website

Developed an interactive educational tool to introduce users to image compression concepts from Stanfordâ€™s ENGR 76 course. Users can input images from the gallery to explore various compression techniques, engage with challenges, and access supplementary videos for further exploration. Features include a navigation bar, dark mode toggle, and scroll animations.

Built with Flask (backend), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (frontend).

Credits: Test images and some helper functions in the image compression code are from the course.
