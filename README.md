# Interactive Image Compression Website

Developed an interactive educational tool to demystify image compression by introducing users to basic image compression concepts and techniques from Stanford University's Engr 76: Information Science and Engineering course.

Users can input different images to test out of the effects of basic image compression techniques. They are challenges that users can try to further engage with the concepts, as well as links to videos for more in depth exploration. Additional features include a navigation bar, toggle dark mode button, and scroll animation.

Utilized Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend.
